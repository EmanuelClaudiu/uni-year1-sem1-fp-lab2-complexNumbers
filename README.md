 The second lab at Fundaments of Programming. Here I used low coupling programming principle for the first time, aswell as getters and setters.
  
Statement:  
  1 - Print the longest sequence with the real part in form of a mountain  
  2 - Print the longest sequence with real and immaginary parts that can both be written using the same base 10 digits
