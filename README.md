# uni-year1-sem1-fp-lab2-complexNumbers
 The second lab at Fundaments of Programming. Here I used low coupling programming principle for the first time, aswell as getters and setters.
  
Statement:  
  
&nbsp;1 - Print the longest sequence with the real part in form of a mountain  
&nbsp;2 - Print the longest sequence with real and immaginary parts that can both be written using the same base 10 digits  
&nbsp;3 - Print the whole list of complex numbers  
    
Can either input a list of complex numbers, or use a predefined one  
This homework solution is not fully functional.
